# Outline: 
due to the development of the software acquisition and definition in what we use the code theory always in messy and unforeseeable status. A new method of the coding style like VPCS that will show in this topic paper, feel free to resonate with my imagination of the portrait—VPCS(Vision, Process, Controller, Sets) theory, fun yet? Not only this paper will gazer a big point how we show the constructions of the VPCS, you guys also sure to get lots of idyllic landscapes of the coding sections. While you got lots of the illness codes at the so messy fungus projects, I guess at this paper out where you are finding anxiously. Let’s catch more opportunity about how does the VPCS working, executing and scheduling in our software project and make the software fast, fast and safe! lets go, So the key words as below:

# VPCS_Theroy
software coding theory 准备写本1500页的书。

##### 本论文一种超小型，原生，将执行和控制分开，将数据和任务分开的类似酒店管理的编程思想
##### 解决了怎么在一个超微型的计算机设备中执行安全可控高并发的互联网后端请求。
##### 并附带了各种应用实例。
##### 比如在手机上同时部署20个后端服务器，
##### 比如在桌面上应用做软件线程业务逻辑
##### 比如在互联网项目中做rest call 线程任务处理
##### 比如在数据库软件中做增删改查的控制引擎。等等
